      <h1>ACADEMIC JOURNEY AND SOCIAL LIFE</h1>
      <h2>Learning ability, Endurance threshold and Resilience.</h2>
      <p>
        I've been an average student all my academic life. My cognitive and
        psychological capacity in acquiring or learning new concepts during
        studies has been quite average. It often take a bit longer for me to grasp,
        process and assimilate new ideas.

        Haven discovered this at the earlier stage of my education, I developed
        and initiated a study pattern and routine that will constantly help me
        accomodate and overcome my disability and eventually catch up with
        others. My threshold for endurance during studies grew substantially by
        the day. Been resilient and focused whatever problem I am solving
        because I will have to spend more time to practice and go over again and
        again. I got more use to this and it was working just well for
        My grades. Sometimes I end up with A's, most times B's and C's, failed a
        couple of time as well.

        This has been My learning strategy and pattern over the years and now
        I'm here in AltSchool trying to learn a new skill. This is so far one
        of the biggest challenge I ever faced. I pray I overcome this challenge
        just like I always have.

      <h2>Social life, Music and Fashion</h2>
      <p>
        My social life over the years has been quite fluctuating. Often depends
        on situations and the cartegory of persons around at a particular period
      </p>
      <p>
        Two things I've loved My whole life has been <b>Fashion</b> and
        <b>Music</b>. I find so much peace in music whenever I'm listening or making it. I spend most of
        My free time in the studio recording. A very good talent I've got.
