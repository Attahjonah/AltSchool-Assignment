            <h2>Tech career journey, decision and Altschool Africa</h2>
            <p>
              My first experience in Tech was when i took some elective courses
              from the Electrical Enginering and Computer Science Departments
              during My under graduate programm and studies at the University.
              To be honest I never liked it because I thought it too hard and it
              was getting boring. I infact hated the Course.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interest in Tech started when I was doing my National Youth
              Service at the NBS. We were often exposed to certain field works
              that required some level and knowledge of
              <strong>Data Analysis</strong>. That was when I began to develop
              much interest in the Tech world. My perception of the whole thing
              took a tremendous turn and I began to see it as a life changing
              opportunity if I can find the right and perfect avenue to dive
              into it. That was when Altschool Africa presented itself and I
              took advantage by applying.

                Secondly, I did my research on Altschool Africa and i realised
                they happen to provide almost the perfect kind and mode of
                learning that i require, owing to the fact that I'm a slow
